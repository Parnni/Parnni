### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a Mechanical Engineer with a year of experience in the field of Machine Tool Design.

Most recently, I worked at Precihole Machine Tools as a Trainee Design Engineer where I worked primarily on Honing machine and designed mandrels for different honing sizes. Prior to joining this company, I worked at Mahisa Packaging Systems as a Mechanical design intern where I designed a melting tank for Hot Melt Adhesive Dispensing Machine.

Currently, I am enhancing my skills in Machine Learning to solve Mechanical Engineering problems.
