### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a Mechanical Engineer with a year of experience in the field of Machine Tool design and I am on a mission to switch my career to Artificial Intelligence.

Currently, I am developing skills in Machine and Deep Learning. My end goal is to become an expert in Artificial Intelligence and FORCE robots to do cool backflips.
